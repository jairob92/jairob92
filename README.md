My Test Automation Projects
<br>

- [Selenium Automation with reports](https://github.com/jairob92/AutomationWithSelenium) - Project where I applied basic knowledge of Selenium with Java, utilizing Log4j2 for logging and ExtendReports for reporting.

- [UI Automation using Cypress with Cucumber](https://github.com/jairob92/AutomationWithCypress) - This repository contains a basic test automation project using Cypress and Cucumber. The chosen design approach is the Page Object Model (POM), enhancing code organization and maintenance. Additionally, the project utilizes the Gherkin language for scenario specification.
  
- [API Testing with Cypress ](https://github.com/jairob92/Backend-Testing-using-Cypress) - This practical project showcasing backend automation using Cypress! In this project, we use Cypress along with a local "json-server" to simulate an API and perform various HTTP requests.
